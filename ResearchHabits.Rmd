# Plotting

## Some rules for good graphics
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf

1. Design graphics to highlight comparisons you want the reader to make.
1. Choose scales to facilitate comparisons.
1. Use a sensible aspect ratio. width:height of about 1.6, unless axes are on the same scale.
1. Prepare graphics in final aspect ratio. Distorted fonts look awful.
1. Use vector graphics such as eps or pdf.
1. Clear labels and detailed captions.
1. Avoid cluttered legends.
1. Specify units.
1. Label axes.

## Reproducibility

\begin{block}{}
Someone should be able to reproduce your thesis without having to guess what software you had installed, what versions, which files do what, etc.
\end{block}\vspace*{-0.2cm}\pause

 * Stay organized.
 * One system for doing this using R is to write your thesis in an Rmarkdown file.
 * Track software versions

\fontsize{12}{12}\sf\vspace*{0.5cm}\pause

\begin{block}{}
\texttt{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\ setup,\ include=FALSE\}}\newline
\texttt{knitr::opts\_chunk\$set(echo=FALSE)\ writeLines(capture.output(sessionInfo()),}\newline
\texttt{\hspace*{1cm}   "sessionInfo.txt")}
\end{block}

## Version control
\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

 * `thesis_v1`, `thesis_v2`, etc., is not adequate version control.
 * You need to track changes over time, have a remote repository, and be able to roll back as required.
 * Your repository should contain *everything* required to produce your thesis including computer code, references, writing.
 * Someone should be able to reproduce your thesis from your repository without having to guess what software you had installed, what software versions, which files do what, etc.
 * **Github** solves these problems

## Plagiarism

\placefig{1.4}{1.35}{width=11.4cm, trim=0 3 0 0, clip=true}{plagiarism}\vspace*{6.7cm}

 * Never plagiarise from other papers — not even sentence fragments. Use your own words.

## Words to avoid

**According to Andrew Gelman**

 * Note that
 * Interestingly
 * It is interesting to note that
 * Obviously
 * It is clear that
 * very
 * quite
 * of course
 * Notice that

\item Write something every day.
\item Set a word or paragraph goal for each session.
\item Practice makes \st{perfect} better.
\item Writing clarifies thinking.
\item Build on a scaffold.
