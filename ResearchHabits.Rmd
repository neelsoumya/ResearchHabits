# Reproducibility

## Reproducibility

Someone (possibly future you) should be able to reproduce your thesis from your repository without having to guess what software you had installed, what software versions, which files do what, etc.

Stay organized.

One system for doing this using R is to write your thesis in an Rmarkdown file.

Track software versions:

\begin{block}{}
\texttt{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\ setup,\ include=FALSE\}}\newline
\texttt{knitr::opts\_chunk\$set(echo=FALSE)\ writeLines(capture.output(sessionInfo()),}\newline
\texttt{\hspace*{1cm}   "sessionInfo.txt")}\newline

## Writing an abstract
\fontsize{15}{19}\sf

 1. What did you do?
 2. Why did you do it? What question were you trying to answer?
 3. How did you do it? State your methods.
 4. What did you learn? State your major results.
 5. Why does it matter? Point out at least one significant implication.

 * No references or citations.
 * Write in the past tense.
 * Be explicit, precise and concise.
 * Stick to a single paragraph.
 * Restrict background information to a sentence or two at most.
 * Make sure that your abstract is consistent with what you reported in the paper.
 * Write the abstract last

## Names and titles
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf

 * Your name is your brand. Choose one and stick to it.\pause

 * Titles should be informative, short and catchy (in that order).\pause

    - Optimal forecast reconciliation for hierarchical and grouped time series through trace minimization
    - Exploring the sources of uncertainty: why does bagging for time series forecasting work?
    - Do levels of airborne grass pollen influence asthma hospital admissions?
    - Unmasking the Theta method
    - I am not an econometrician\pause

 * Some journals don't like imaginative titles.

## Some rules for good graphics
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf

1. Design graphics to highlight comparisons you want the reader to make.
1. Choose scales to facilitate comparisons.
1. Use a sensible aspect ratio. width:height of about 1.6, unless axes are on the same scale.
1. Prepare graphics in final aspect ratio. Distorted fonts look awful.
1. Use vector graphics such as eps or pdf.
1. Clear labels and detailed captions.
1. Avoid cluttered legends.
1. Specify units.
1. Label axes.

## Plagiarism

\placefig{1.4}{1.35}{width=11.4cm, trim=0 3 0 0, clip=true}{plagiarism}\vspace*{6cm}

 * Never plagiarise from other papers â€” not even sentence fragments. Use your own words.
 * Donâ€™t plagiarise from your own papers either.

## Excuses

\placefig{6.8}{0}{width=6.3cm, height=9.6cm}{htwal}
\begin{textblock}{6.5}(0,1.4)
\begin{itemize}
\item There's not enough time
\item I need to read more articles before I begin
\item I need a new computer, a better printer, etc.
\item I'm waiting for inspiration
\end{itemize}
\end{textblock}

## How to write a lot
\placefig{6.8}{0}{width=6.3cm, height=9.6cm}{htwal}
\begin{textblock}{6.5}(0,1.4)
\begin{itemize}
\item Block out a regular writing time (e.g., 2 hours every morning).
\item Write something every day.
\item Set a word or paragraph goal for each session.
\item Practice makes \st{perfect} better.
\item Writing clarifies thinking.
\item Build on a scaffold.
\end{itemize}
\end{textblock}

# Version control

## Version control
\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

 * `thesis_v1`, `thesis_v2`, etc., is not adequate version control.
 * You need to track changes over time, have a remote repository, and be able to roll back as required.
 * Your repository should contain *everything* required to produce your thesis including computer code, references, writing.
 * Someone should be able to reproduce your thesis from your repository without having to guess what software you had installed, what software versions, which files do what, etc.
 * **Github** solves these problems
